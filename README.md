# My reading notes journal for code 102d44

Hi, my name is **Ryan Papsin**.

*Growth mindset* in my own words is learning **without** *limits or restraints*. Three things I will remind myself so I don't fall into a *fixed* mindet are:

1. **Taking a break** in itself can solve the problem.
2. Remind myself that I am **creating** something. 
3. That **everyone** started exactly where I am.

# Happy Halloween!
