  # Choosing the right text editor.
  
Choosing a text editor can seem like an overwhelming task with so many options and opinions. The four main features to look for in a text editor are code completion, syntax highlighting, a variety of themes, and a large selection of extensions. Code completion allows you to start the code and the feature will finish the code. This saves not only time but will help not get fatigued. Syntax highlighting will categorize the text and makes it more noticeable with different colors. An example of this would be the attributes will be a different color than the element. Themes allow the user to customize the display of the text editor. Different themes or brightnesses can help with fatigue. Extensions are plugins that help increase productivity. It is important to not only find the text editor that works best for you but also familiarize yourself with that text editor to maximize efficiency and productivity.
