1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I have no idea. Trying to figure that out.


2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Understand the problem to the point of explaining it in plain English.

2. Plan out and write down the steps.

3. Divide the overall problem into sub-problems.
