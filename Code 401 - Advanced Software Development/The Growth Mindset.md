The reading "Upgrade Your Technical Skills" is a good reminder that learning something new is hard work and hard work needs to be put into it. Also, I need to be more deliberate with studying.

The video "The Power Of Believing That You Can Improve" is a good reminder that the mindset of learning can greatly change the outcome. It was also very interesting the differences between the mindsets on the imagery.

The video "The Power Of Passion And Perseverance"  is a good reminder that failure is part of learning anything. That failure is not permanent.  

The video "A Kiner, Gentler Philosophy Of Sucess" was very interesting. Understanding what is success to me and my own.

Emotional Intelligence is very important and is not easy all the time. Emotional intelligence is something that I continually work on. Everybody has their triggers and it's good to know your own.

Everyone has their biases. We have them without even realizing sometimes. It's good to remember that nobody is perfect and staying open-minded is important.
