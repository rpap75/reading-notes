Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
You can control alignment in one axis, a row, or a column, not both together as we can do in the grid.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and the cross axis.
The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is a row your main axis is along the row, if it is a column your main axis is along the column.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Reorders the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document.

CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
-Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
-Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
-Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

2. How does this topic connect with your long-term goals?
I'm not sure.
