HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

the href attribute

2. The href attribute contains what information?

Content categories, Permitted content, Tag omission, Permitted parents, and Implicit ARIA role.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.
Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different color and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't be broken, as users are used to it).
Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.
Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".

CSS

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout>).

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

 Block level elements takes up the space from the prior line and starts at the next line. A inline element will not take up space or start on a new line.

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static positioning.

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

Easy to position elements.

5.What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

 whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning#fixed_positioning>).

JS

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

Declaration is more of naming a function, whereas invocation is calling the function.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

 Arguments are values. Parameters are variables.

Miscellaneous

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

Work enviroment I think is huge. Learning how to work as a team in projects can be difficult. Engage collaboration I find is a more efficient way to handle a task or problem. Troubleshooting becomes a whole lot  easier.
