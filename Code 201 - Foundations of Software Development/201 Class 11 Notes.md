Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
In the early 2000s, there were iPods, the sidekick phone, and handheld cameras for both video and pictures. Now in the size of the iPod, you have all three with faster and much better quality in pictures and video. The one thing that has changed to the negative is how often something is 'broke' or has a bug or whatever the reason. With so much going on, on our phones we could only expect that.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
src is for the source (location) of the file. Controls attribute adds controls for the video.

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
Fallback content is important because it provides a link to the video if the URL fails.

4.Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
Once upon a time, there was a lonely video that couldn't speak. There was also a lonely audio who couldn't see. One day they met and together they could see and speak. The End.

A Complete Guide To Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
Grid is two-dimensional, whereas flex is one.

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

Grid container defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

The grid item is the children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container. Here the item elements are grid items, but the sub-item isn’t.

A grid line is the dividing line that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.
