JavaScript structure: conditionals, loops, and functions. Sometimes events.

JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A function in JavaScript executes when "something" invokes it (calls it).

JavaScript function is defined with the *function* keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses ().

Functions often compute a **return** value.

The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"

A **function definition** (also called a **function declaration**, or **function statement**)

**Calling** the function actually performs the specific actions with the indicated parameter.
