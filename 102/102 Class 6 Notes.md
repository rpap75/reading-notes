Class 6 Notes

JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

Known as a scripting language.

JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with proven tools for building scalable, interactive web applications.

JavaScript provides three different value comparison operations: strict equality using ===, loose equality using ==, and the Object.is() method.

4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:

Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
