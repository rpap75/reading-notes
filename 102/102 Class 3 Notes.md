# Git

Git is a **Distributed Version Control System** *(DVCS)* that uses *"snapshots"* to store data. Git will save changes on your project by the use of a *commit*. Get will then create a snapshot and store a reference. Git eliminates the need to fetch information from the server because it relies on local operations, which expedites the process. Git's tracking will apply changes to any file and will detect file corruption or loss of data. The three states of Git are committed, modified, and staged. Committed is when data is securely stored in a local database. Modified is when a file has been changed but not committed to the database. Stages is a flagged file changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
