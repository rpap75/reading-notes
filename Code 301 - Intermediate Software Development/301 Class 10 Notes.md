Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. What is a ‘call’?

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

Function invocation

3. What does LIFO mean?

Last In, First Out

4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

function firstFunction(){ console.log(" firstFunction"); }

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

JavaScript error messages

1. What is a ‘reference error’?

When you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

2. What is a ‘syntax error’?

When you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

3. What is a ‘range error’?

To manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

4. What is a ‘type error’?

This types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

5. What is a breakpoint?

The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

To find the exact point where you made a programming mistake.
